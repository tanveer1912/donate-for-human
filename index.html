            <p>7 year-old Sihab is one of the 1.6 million children affected by the floods that have devasted
                north-eastern Bangladesh this year. His entire village was hit with severe flooding following the
                rainfall, leaving his home underwater. His family is sheltering in a school building, without enough
                food. “I’ve only eaten dried rice with milk today because there are six of us and not enough rations for
                all of us,” Sihab says.

                Children like Sihab need your urgent support for emergency supplies, nutrition, dry food storage, clean
                water and hygiene kits. Join us to give hope and emergency relief to children like Sihab</p>
